# BP-Topic-discovery-Neural-Network
Repository for my bachelors thesis where I try to create a neural network made for discovering topics in a given text.

Structure:
 - model - file with the trained model
 - TEST_MODEL - file where all the model iterations were saved while training
 - fine_tuning.py - script for training the model
 - model_testing.py - script for testing the model
 - predictions.csv - file with a given text, prediction made by my model and reference label 
 - script.py - basic script for playing aroundwith pre-trained models
